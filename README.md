# City Block Simulator
A city block simulator game base.

Inspired by combining ideas from Destroy All Humans and Hitman; meaning you're an interdimensional ethereal hitman/handyman that can bodysnatch and manipulate objects. You are dropped in a simulated world where every entity is on their own schedule, until the player interferes and changes their trajectory, vector or timing.

The core of the game is that it is primarily a stealth game where your stealthiness is rewarded by how much subtle impact you make without making people freak out, or you can freak everyone out and cause chaos, your choice. As long as you reach your goal (and the simulation still keeps up).

## Additional Mechanics
The game has some additional aspects to make gameplay interesting, like an ability to travel back in time and play the simulation over from the start, including the player's interferences and their calculated consequences.



# Phases
There are several phases to gradually expand the simulation, from the simplest prototype and proof of concept, to a city block simulation, to a full city simulation, and eventually scale it up to limitless proportions.
